I graduated with a bachelor of science in astrophysics from Michigan State University. Prior to MSU, I obtained an associate in science in engineering and physics through an early college program at Lansing Community College. Most recently, I was a physics graduate student at the University of Rochester studying lunar accretion disks. I left the program and have decided to focus on data science instead. In my free time I enjoy photography. In addition to terrestrial photography, I am also an amateur astrophotographer.
