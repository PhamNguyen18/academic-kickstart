Welcome! I am a former physics graduate student with an interest in data science. I graduated with a BSc in Astrophysics from Michigan State University where I studied lunar materials from the Apollo missions in collaboration with Albion College. In graduate school, I studied the dynamics of lunar accretion disks. I now work as a mainframe software developer with an eye towards data science in the future. In my spare time I enjoy photography and observing the night sky.
