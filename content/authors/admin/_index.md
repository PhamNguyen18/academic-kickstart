Welcome! I am a former physics graduate student with an interest in data science. I graduated with a BSc in Astrophysics from Michigan State University where I studied lunar materials from the Apollo missions in collaboration with Albion College. In graduate school, I studied the dynamics of lunar accretion disks. Over the past year, I have decided to switch gears and now work as a mainframe developer (resume available upon request). When I'm not noodling with data, I enjoy photography both [space and terrestrial](https://pixelfed.social/LunaAndTerra)!   

I am available through several methods of [secure communication](#contact) including Element, Keybase, and email through Tutanota (I check my email most frequently).
