summary:
abstract: The Moon has been an object of study ever since humans started to observe the sky. Recent decades have seen a revolution in our understanding of the Moon starting with the advent of the Apollo missions. Recovered lunar meteorites and orbital missions have also added to this growing body of knowledge. Despite this wealth of information, many aspects of the Moonâ€™s history remain elusive. In this talk I will discuss new findings that are reshaping our understanding of the formation and impact history of our closest cosmic neighbor.
